# 100 Days of Code

## Day 2

#### Exercise 1 - Data Types

Solution:
```python
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

####################################
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

print(first_digit + second_digit)
```


#### Exercise 2 - BMI Calculator
```python
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height_as_float = float(height)
weight_as_float = float(weight)

bmi = weight_as_float / height_as_float ** 2
print(int(bmi))
```

#### Exercise 4 - Life in Weeks
```python
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
MAX_AGE = 90
DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365
WEEKS_IN_YEAR = 52
MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12

current_age_as_int = int(age)
days_left = (MAX_AGE - current_age_as_int) * DAYS_IN_YEAR
weeks_left = (MAX_AGE - current_age_as_int) * WEEKS_IN_YEAR
months_left = (MAX_AGE - current_age_as_int) * MONTHS_IN_YEAR

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left.")
```

#### Exericese 5 - Tip calculator
```python
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the tip calculator")
total_bill = input("What was the total bill? ")
tip_percentage = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10,12, or 15? ")
people = input('How many people to split the bill? ')

total_as_int = float(total_bill)
tip_percentage_as_int = float(tip_percentage)
people_as_int = int(people)

bill_per_person = total_as_int * (tip_percentage_as_int / 100 + 1) / people_as_int

# rounded_bill_per_person = round(bill_per_person, 2)
rounded_bill_per_person = "{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${rounded_bill_per_person}")
```
